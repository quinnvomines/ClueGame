Our room has 31 rows and 25 columns which is different from 306 board. Our board has 12 doors vs the 306 of 17 doors.

We have a door going to the left for the Student Center, up for the Lecture Hall, down for the Classroom, and right for the
Recreation Center. We also created label and center tests for each of the 9 rooms specifically for our Clue game, which have
different positions from the 306 board. 

We also tested the usage of a secret passage and the unused closet space in room tests. 

Added first last and null checks for cells to make sure we are reading in the file correctly. This was not even present in the fileinit306 tests.
